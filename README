'note' is simply a bash-written notes' tracker
I've written this shit 'cause my home dir is full of
shitty note files and I hate disorder >.>

To install:
    make install
To uninstall:
    make uninstall

Simply

Bai :D

P.S.: To complete the text inserting of note close
      stdin with ^D (Ctrl + D) and you will be happy
